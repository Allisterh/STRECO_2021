# STRECO_2021

**Description**: this `R` code replicates the model developed in M. Sawyer and M. Veronese Passarella [A comprehensive comparison of fiscal and monetary policies: a comparative dynamics approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954349X2100103X), *Structural Change and Economic Dynamics*, 2021, 59(4), pp. 384-404

**Instructions**: download all the files (but "STRECO deterministic model.R") and then run `Run all.R`. I would recommend saving all the files in the same directory/folder. Alternatively, download and run `STRECO deterministic model.R` only, which is a deterministic (and simplified) version of the original model.
