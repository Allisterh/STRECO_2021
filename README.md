# STRECO_2021

R model used in: "A comprehensive comparison of fiscal and monetary policies: a comparative dynamics approach" (with M. Sawyer), Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 2021, 59(4), pp. 384-404. (Go to the article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954349X2100103X).

Instructions: download all the files (but "STRECO deterministic model.R") and then run "Run all.R". I would recommend saving all the files in the same directory/folder. Alternatively, download and run "STRECO deterministic model.R" only, which is a simplified deterministic version of the original model.
